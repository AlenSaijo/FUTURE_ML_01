# Future Interns Task 1: Sales & Demand Forecasting 📈

## 📋 Project Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to forecast future sales and demand using historical business data. The goal is to provide business-ready insights through accurate predictions and clear visualizations.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Data Cleaning:** Preprocessing historical data and handling missing values.
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating time-based features for better model accuracy.
* **Forecasting:** Using regression/time-series methods to predict future demand.
* **Visualization:** generating charts to present forecast trends clearly (e.g., `Figure_1.png`).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
* **Dataset:** `train.csv`

## 📂 File Structure
* `sales_forecasting.py`: The main Python script containing the forecasting logic.
* `train.csv`: The dataset used for training the model.
* `Figure_1.png`: Visual output of the sales forecast.
* `Machine Learning - Future Interns.pdf`: The original task documentation.
